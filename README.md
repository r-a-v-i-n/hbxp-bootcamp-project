<h1>Mapping Fatal Police Shootings</h1> 
<h3>An interactive map using The Washington Post's database of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since Jan. 1, 2015.</h3>

Per The Post's github: "The Post is documenting only those shootings in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian â€” the circumstances that most closely parallel the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., which began the protest movement culminating in Black Lives Matter and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. The Post is not tracking deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths."
